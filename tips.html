            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
              Ghost-hunting can be exciting, and it can also be physically exhausting and mentally challenging. Most of the time, the main requirement to be a ghost hunter is having a lot of patience. You also need to know what to do, how to stay safe, and how to gather all the information you can to ensure a professional investigation. Investigating the paranormal can be fun, but it's also serious business and should be treated with respect and an abundance of caution.            
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
              There is a lot to know when you begin your paranormal investigations. You should always be learning and having an open mind about exploring new things and new ideas. No two paranormal investigators do things in the exact same way, but everyone should have a checklist of the essential items that are needed for their research. What follows is a checklist for the basic, the essential, and the high-tech items that can be used for investigations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
              Here is the list of basic items:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
              <li>Notebook and pen (recording notes, witness statements, and making diagrams)</li>
              <li>Measuring tape (checking distance and witness accounts)</li>
              <li>Extra batteries (you never know when they might fail)</li>
              <li>Flashlight (this requires no explanation)</li>
              <li>Recording device (for witness accounts and for Electronic Voice Phenomenon [EVP])</li>
              <li>Camera</li>
              <li>wo-way radios (allows the group to stay in contact, plus avoids the electromagnetic interference that is caused by cellular phones)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>And a list of high-tech items:</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
              <li>The REM pod: The REM pod can detect a difference in field strength whenever a conductive material enters into its EM field.</li>
              <li>Infrared motion detectors: They can be used to secure an area from intrusion by the living, register the movement of energy fields, and even pick up temperature changes in the monitored area.</li>
              <li>Temperature-sensing devices: It is critical to monitor the ambient temperature of the site. Many sensors on the market can quickly detect temperature changes. When investigators or witnesses talk about cold spots, this is a way to confirm their existence.</li>
              <li>P-SB7 Spirit Box: This device seeks out paranormal voices on the EMF spectrum and because it is believed that spirits contain electromagnetic energy, it makes sense that you can hear them with this device.</li>
              <li>Ovilus: This device was created to convert environmental readings into real words, offering direct responses to your questions.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
              When it comes to maintaining a connection with those who have perished, giving yourself space to find peace while opening up to your loved ones can help you feel close to those who no longer walk the physical realms.

            <h3 class="font-bold">Steps for Using a Ouija Board</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Gather 2 or more people who are willing to communicate with the dead and serious about it. You don’t want to have someone intentionally manipulating the pointer, making the entire activity pointless (pun intended).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Set the ambiance by lowering the lights, placing candles around the room, and removing distractions such as crying babies or cell phones.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Invite conversation with the spirit. This can be done by telling the spirit that it’s safe to speak, introducing yourselves, etc.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Ask simple questions. At first, ask easy yes or no questions, working up to questions that require the spelling of one or more words. If the spirit is weak, you will get more information out of him/her this way. The pointer should eventually slide across the board to the answers to these questions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Don’t forget to firmly end the conversation by saying “Goodbye”. This was already mentioned on the main page, but it’s absolutely critical to end the séance!
